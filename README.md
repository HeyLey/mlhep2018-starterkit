# Metrics

All phases are evaluated with the following metrics with priority descend:

1) **acc_at_80** - 80-percentile of classification accuraces, averaged across each event (one event is (192,192,192) tensor)
2) **acc_at_50** - 50-percentile (median) of classification accuraces, averaged across each event
2) **acc_mean** - mean classification accuracy, each accuracy is averaged across each event (one event is (192,192,192) tensor)

All metrics implemented in [metrics.py](metrics.py) script
